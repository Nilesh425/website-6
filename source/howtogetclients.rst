How to Get Clients
-------------------------------------

There are two ways in getting the client code of each service in each language.

- Get pre-generated client from download page in github `this download page <https://github.com/jubatus/jubatus/downloads>`_ 

- Use .idl file in repository and generate client code by using msgpack-idl

In the following section, we explain these methods in detail.

Use pre-generated client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As explained later, client codes are generated from msgpack-idl. But if you want to use client code casually, it recommended that you should use client library that is already generated by Jubatus developers.

You can download these clients from here `this download page <https://github.com/jubatus/jubatus/downloads>`_ .


Generate clients from msgpack-idl
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can generate client codes using by using .idl file and `msgpack-idl <http://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-haskell/tree/master/msgpack-idl>`_. msgpack-idl requires ghc7 and cabal.
The followings are exapmle of generating clients (and servers). In this exapmle, we generate clients of classifier.


::

  $ cabal install classifier.idl
  $ mpidl cpp classifier.idl -o . -p
  ...
  $ ls
  kvs_types.hpp kvs_client.hpp kvs_server.hpp

Application developers can easily support clients written in multiple programming languages by using this code-generating system.
